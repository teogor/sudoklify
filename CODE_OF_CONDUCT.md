# Sudoklify Community Guidelines

At Sudoklify, we cherish the innovation and collaboration of open-source contributors, embracing a diversity of skills, experiences, cultures, and opinions in the projects and communities they participate in.

Every one of Sudoklify's open-source projects and communities fosters inclusivity, treating all individuals with respect, irrespective of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or similar personal characteristics.

We value a range of opinions, but we prioritize respectful conduct.

Respectful conduct entails:

- Being considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
- Refraining from engaging in demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, sexualized, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
- Avoiding unwanted physical contact.

Certain Sudoklify open-source projects [may adopt][] an explicit project code of conduct, which may feature additional detailed expectations for participants. Most of these projects will use our [adapted Contributor Covenant][].

## Resolve Conflicts Peacefully

We believe that not all conflict is inherently negative; productive debates and disagreements often yield positive outcomes. However, being disrespectful is never acceptable.

If you notice disrespectful behavior, we encourage you to address the issue directly with those involved. Many problems can be swiftly resolved, granting individuals more control over the resolution of their disputes. If you're unable to resolve the issue for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are committed to providing a welcoming and secure environment for participants.

## Reporting Issues

Certain Sudoklify open-source projects may adopt a project-specific code of conduct. In such instances, a designated Sudoklify representative will be the Project Steward, responsible for receiving and handling reports of code of conduct violations. If a project hasn't assigned a Project Steward, you can report problems by emailing open-source@teogor.dev.

We will investigate all complaints; however, direct responses may not always be provided. We will use our discretion in determining how and when to address reported incidents, which can range from taking no action to permanent removal from the project and project-related spaces. We will inform the accused party of the report and grant them an opportunity to address it before any action is taken. The identity of the reporter will be withheld from the accused party. In cases of potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to safety, we may take immediate action without notice.
