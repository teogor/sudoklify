## A Powerful Sudoku Puzzle Generation Library

üß© Sudoklify is a versatile and intuitive Sudoku puzzle generation library written in Kotlin. It
provides a comprehensive set of tools and algorithms for generating Sudoku puzzles of various grid
sizes and difficulty levels.

## Key Features

- Efficient and customizable Sudoku puzzle generation algorithms ‚ú®
- Support for different grid sizes, including 4x4, 9x9, 16x16, and more üìê
- Multiple difficulty levels - Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert üåü
- Flexible token mapping system for personalized puzzle representation üé®
- Intuitive API for puzzle generation, population, and solution retrieval üß©
- Randomization techniques for puzzle layout and digit placement üîÄ

## Sudoklify: Redefining Puzzle Generation

Sudoklify reimagines the way Sudoku puzzles are generated, delivering a lightning-fast experience without compromising quality. Here's a glimpse into what makes Sudoklify stand out:

### Innovative Puzzle Creation

Traditional Sudoku generators rely on gradually removing numbers from a solved grid, often requiring extensive time and backend resources. Sudoklify, however, operates differently. It starts with a solvable "seed" puzzle and applies a series of ingenious transformations to craft new puzzles. This approach ensures rapid puzzle creation without the need for a complex backend infrastructure.

### Unparalleled Puzzle Diversity

Every seed used by Sudoklify unlocks a staggering number of unique puzzles‚Äîover 2.4 trillion! To put this into perspective, if you were to solve a puzzle every 3 minutes, it would take more than 13 million lifetimes to exhaust a single seed. üéâ

### Transformative Algorithms at Play

Sudoklify leverages a diverse set of transformations to create distinctive puzzles:

- **Board Rotation**: Incorporates four permutations (0¬∞, 90¬∞, 180¬∞, 270¬∞).
- **Column Stacks Shuffle**: Features six permutations (3!).
- **Row Bands Shuffle**: Offers another six permutations (3!).
- **Column Shuffle**: Provides a whopping 216 permutations (3! x 3! x 3!).
- **Row Shuffle**: Adds another 216 permutations (3! x 3! x 3!).
- **Number Swapping**: Introduces an incredible 362,880 permutations (9!).

Combining these transformations results in a staggering number of permutations per seed‚Äî2,437,996,216,320. This extensive variety guarantees that each puzzle is a uniquely captivating challenge. üß†üß©üöÄ

## Usage

### Generating Sudoku Puzzles

To generate Sudoku puzzles using Sudoklify, follow these steps:

1. Add Sudoklify as a dependency in your project.

2. Create a `ParamsBuilder` to configure the puzzle generation parameters.

```kotlin
import dev.teogor.sudoklify.sudokuParamsBuilder
import dev.teogor.sudoklify.model.Difficulty
import dev.teogor.sudoklify.model.Type

// Configure puzzle generation parameters
val params = sudokuParamsBuilder {
    difficulty { Difficulty.MEDIUM }
    seed { 12345L }
    type { Type.THREE_BY_THREE }
}
```
3. Generate the Sudoku puzzle using the `generateSudoku` extension function.

```kotlin
import dev.teogor.sudoklify.extensions.generateSudoku

val generatedSudoku = sudokuParams.generateSudoku()
```

### Accessing Generated Sudoku

The `generatedSudoku` instance contains the puzzle and solution strings, difficulty level, and grid type. You can access these properties as follows:

```kotlin
val puzzleString = generatedSudoku.puzzle
val solutionString = generatedSudoku.solution
val difficulty = generatedSudoku.difficulty
val type = generatedSudoku.type

// Print the properties
println("Puzzle: $puzzleString")
println("Solution: $solutionString")
println("Difficulty: $difficulty")
println("Grid Type: $type")
```
