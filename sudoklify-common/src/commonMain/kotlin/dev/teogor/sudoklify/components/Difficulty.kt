 * | Difficulty | Clues (%) | Givens (%) | Symmetry | Description |
 * |---|---|---|---|---|
 * | VERY_EASY | 60-80 | 80-100 | Yes | These puzzles are designed for beginners and have a large number of clues filled in, making them easy to solve. |
 * | EASY | 40-60 | 60-80 | Yes | These puzzles are still relatively easy to solve but require more effort than VERY_EASY puzzles. |
 * | MEDIUM | 20-40 | 40-60 | Yes | These puzzles are a good challenge for experienced solvers and require careful deduction. |
